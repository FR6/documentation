## Access Site Plan
1. Go to the Site Dashboard.
2. For Sandbox sites, click the **Upgrade** button:
 ![Upgrade plan button shown on Sandbox sites](/source/docs/assets/images/dashboard/upgrade-plan.png)
 Otherwise, click the **current plan**:
 ![Change current plan for paid sites](/source/docs/assets/images/dashboard/change-plan.png)

Plan changes take immediate effect. The associated card will be charged or credited a prorated amount upon upgrade or downgrade.

<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p markdown="1">Changing your site plan is typically done at launch time. For a comprehensive step-by-step guide to going live, refer to [Launch Essentials](/docs/guides/launch/).</p></div>

### Roles & Permissions
The permission to manage a site's plan is granted only to the roles of **Site Owner** / **User in Charge** / **Organization Administrator**. Other roles do not have access to change the site plan as described on this page. For details, see <a href="/docs/change-management/#site-level-roles-and-permissions" data-proofer-ignore>Role-Based Permissions & Change Management</a>.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p markdown="1">If you need to assume site and billing ownership, the current Site Owner must [transfer it to you directly](/docs/site-billing#transfer-ownership-and-billing-for-this-site).</p></div>

## Considerations
Consider the following changes to feature access _before_ upgrading or downgrading the site's plan. Certain scenarios require code changes in order to safely change the site plan.
### Basic Plan
[New Relic](/docs/new-relic/), [Redis](/docs/redis/), and [Solr](/docs/solr) are not available for Basic plans. These features must be disabled in order to select Basic as the new site plan when upgrading or downgrading plans.

For Redis and Solr, the following code changes are required before the feature can be safely disabled:

<!-- Nav tabs -->
<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <!-- Active tab -->
  <li id="wp-id" role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#wp" aria-controls="wp" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">WordPress</a></li>
  <!-- 2nd Tab Nav -->
  <li id="drops-id" role="presentation"><a href="#drops" aria-controls="drops" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- Tab panes -->
<div class="tab-content">
  <!-- Active pane content -->
  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="wp" markdown="1">
#### Safely Uninstall & Disable Redis
1. Uninstall the [WP Redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/){.external} plugin.
2. Delete the `wp-content/object-cache.php` file.
3. Commit and deploy code changes to the Live environment.
4. Go to **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Settings** > **Add Ons** and click the **Remove** button for Redis.
#### Safely Uninstall & Disable Solr

2. Ensure the [default search mechanism](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Search_Parameter){.external} is functioning.
3. Commit and deploy code changes to the Live environment.
4. Go to **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Settings** > **Add Ons** and click the **Remove** button for Solr.

### Sandbox Plan
[Custom domains](/docs/domains/#custom-domains) are not available to Sandbox plans. Downgrading to a Sandbox plan will **automatically delete** existing custom domains across all environments of the site. If you decide to return to a paid plan in the future, you will need to add the domains again.

Downgrading to a Sandbox plan will disable automatic backups. You will be able to create backups manually. For details, see [Backups Tool](/docs/backups/).

## Purchase a New Plan
Review the [previous section](#basic-plan) on feature availability before switching plans to Basic.
### Select Plan
1. Go to the Site Dashboard.
2. For Sandbox sites, click the **Upgrade** button. Otherwise, select the current plan.
3. Click **Select** to switch plans:

Ownership is directly tied to the user account entering billing information.
